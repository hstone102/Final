Objective- The objective of my project will be to make an online charting system that can provide
production and scheduling analytics back to the user and managers.  A user can create
and do all of their documentation online, which will make it easier for superivsors' to
sign off on and send immediate feedback.  

Users-  This type of application could be used by any case management, medical office,  
or home visiting service.  

Problem- Currently, all charts are hand written and repetitive in their documentation.  
Social workers and service providers often spend a lot of their work time documenting their
services.  If their was a more efficient way to document, it would free up more time to help
families.  In addition, a lot of resources are expended to provide services in the community and
efficiency is imperative.  By having a way to look at trends with workers and families,
services can be better utilized to serve more families.  For instance, if a certain family tends
to cancel 75% of their appointments before noon, but cancel only 25% of their appointments
made in the afternoon, that worker could schedule only in the after noon, which would reduce that
worker having to go to the family twice in one week or sometimes more.  

File Structure- There would be a main index page where users would login.  They would then be taken to a dashboard where they can input forms, a visit, a brief contact, or a referral.  Each link would go to it's own page and the user would select the client that they were documenting on.  The user would input the standard documentation and sign it using an electronic signature.  Then the file would be sent to the supervisor to review and sign off on to be entered into the main chart.  Each individual client being served would also have an analytics page where you can see the rate at which they keep appointments, if they keep
more frequently when reminded, if a certain day of the week or time results in more cancellations.  Supervisors will be able to see the different workers and how often families cancel on them, if this is due to the worker cancelling or the family.  Or if 1 family was the result of 75% of their cancellations.  And if certain times of day/day of the week are more frequent times for a worker to cancel.  

Design Concerns- Since I have been in the non-profit world, I know that usability is imperative with technology.  The design must be simple and easy to read and understand.  Too much design will lead to the user getting frustrated and less likely to enjoy using the technology.  

Data to Store-  Each client that is being served will have an online profile that has all of their demographic information.  Other information that will be stored are the cancellations, reschedules, and the times and days of the week for these so the analytics can be easily stores.  This would best be done with a database of some sort.  Security will be vital to this application as it will have a large amount of sensitive data.  

How the Pages Will Look- The pages will look simple with easy to follow instruction and guidance on what the user should do next.  An easy looking template will allow for users to feel calm when looking at the pages as they could be spending a lot of time.
